#IDEA 4
# This game uses a home made function, adds in a counter and has a choice of levels.

import random

# create variables:
counter = 1  ------------------------------------------NEW ADDITION

# Create the function is_same()
def is_same(target, number):
    if target == number:
        result="Win"
    elif target > number:
        result="Low"
    else:
        result="High"

    return result

# Ask for users level choice:  -----------------------------------------------------------------------NEW ADDITION
level = input("Hello.\nPlease choose which game to play: Easy, Medium or Hard?\ne/m/h:")

while level != "e" and level != "m" and level != "h":
    level = input("Sorry. You must type in one of the letters 'e', 'm' or 'h'\ne/m/h:")

# select level    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------NEW ADDITON
if level == "e":
    upper_limit = 10
elif level == "m":
    upper_limit = 20
else:
    upper_limit = 100
    
# Think of a number
computer_number = random.randint(1, upper_limit)      ---------------------------------NEW ADDITION

# Start the game
print("\nI have thought of a number between 1 and ", upper_limit)   ---------------------NEW ADDTION






now the idea to this level is to make the game more interesting by giving the players levels to choose from EASY, MEDIUM AND HARD. 

firstly,Starting with the create variable:we must add a counter variable from the start this tells the game where to start from

secondly, we introduced the #ask for users level choice: this willl ask the player to pick a level from the options 

thirdly,#select level : this we create the code for the level with limits. 10, 20, and 100

forthly, we create the number limit. #think of a number: unlike the previous code were we used random.randint(1,100) or (1,10) where we made the game easy
this time since we have options and hvae created a level we use : computer_number = random.randint(1, upper_limit)this code will pick according to the level the 
player picks.

finally, # start the game : instead of print("\nI have thought of a number between 1 and 100 or 1 and 10.... used in the previous code we change it to 
print("\nI have thought of a number between 1 and ", upper_limit)   ---------------------NEW ADDTION
